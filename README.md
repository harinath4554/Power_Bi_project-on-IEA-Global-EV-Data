# 🚗 Global EV Sales Analysis (2010–2024) | Power BI Dashboard
# 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analytical dashboard built using Power BI to explore global Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends from 2010 to 2024.
The analysis focuses on regional growth, powertrain adoption, transport modes, key EV parameters, and time-series trends, transforming raw data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations.

The dashboard is designed as a portfolio-ready project, demonstrating skills in:

- Data modeling & transformation

- DAX calculations

- Business-focused storytelling

- Advanced Power BI visualization design

# 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The report is structured into four major analytical sections:

## 1️⃣ Regional & Category Trends

- Total EV value by region over time

- Regions with the highest EV growth

- Top 5 regions driving EV adoption in the latest year

- EV penetration across vehicle categories (Cars, Buses, Trucks, Vans)

- Category dominance by region

- Comparison of EV performance in developed vs. developing regions

## 2️⃣ Powertrain & Mode Insights

- Distribution of EVs by powertrain (BEV, PHEV, FCEV)

- Fastest-growing powertrain globally

- Powertrain adoption across transport modes

- Mode share by powertrain type

- Dominant mode–powertrain combinations by region

- Powertrain comparison: 2020 vs. 2023(in our data last year is 2023 there no 2024 data)

- 5-year trend analysis for each powertrain

## 3️⃣ Parameter & Unit Analysis

- Most frequently recorded EV parameters

- Regional contribution by parameter

- EV energy consumption trends by region

- Unit distribution across parameters

- Stock vs. new registrations (YoY)

- Regions with highest recent EV sales

## 4️⃣ Time Series & Comparative Analysis

- Global EV stock growth (year-wise)

- EV growth comparison for top 3 regions

- Cumulative EV value across years

- BEV vs. PHEV trend comparison

- Peak year identification for EV sales/stock by region

- Category-wise single-year spikes
